""" 
Python script for examining GeoPackage to be used as an input for EODIE [https://eodie.readthedocs.io/en/latest/]

Inputs:
One GeoPackage file (extension .gpkg)

Output prints to terminal (for each layer):
- layer name
- geometry type
- feature count 
- attribute field names 

Usage: python examine_geopackage.py path/to/geopackage.gpkg
